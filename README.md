# wws-bot
A very simple Discord moderation bot designed to be an alternitive to the popular MEEE6 bot, leaving out all the uneccesarry features and just the basic tools.

Written in Discord.JS and designed to be self-hosted.

## Run the bot:

1. paste your token and clientId in config.example.json
2. rename the config.example.json to confg.json (don't share your token with anyone!)
3. run `node deploy-commands.js`
4. run `index.js` to start the bot.
