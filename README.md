# wws-bot

A very simple Discord moderation bot designed to be an alternative to the popular MEEE6 bot, leaving out all the unnecessary features and just the basic tools.

Written in Discord.JS and designed to be self-hosted.

## Run the bot

1. paste your token and clientId in config.example.json
2. rename the config.example.json to config.json (don't share your token with anyone!)
3. run `node deploy-commands.js`
4. run `index.js` to start the bot.
